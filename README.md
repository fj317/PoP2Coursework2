#Principles of Programming 2 Coursework 2. 
8 programs in C &amp; Java to solve some simple problems:

'Built in methods used' excludes using output functions or any methods that are used for inputting the files used for testing (as these were not part of the original task itself).
Note: as length (of an array) is a property rather than method in Java it is not included.

###Q1
Language: *C*\n
Built in methods used: None\n
Own implementation methods: strlen, stringToInt (rough reimplementation of strtol), pow, intToString (reimplementation of sprintf), createRand (rather than using rand).\n

###Q2
Language: *Java*\n
Built in methods used: toCharArray\n
Own implementation methods: getChar\n

###Q3
Language: *C*\n
Built in methods used: malloc, realloc, sizeOf\n
Own implementation methods: strlen (& created own boolean type)\n

###Q4
Language: *Java*\n

###Q5
Language: *C*\n
Built in methods used: malloc, sizeOf\n
Own implementation methods: strlen (& created own boolean type)\n

###Q6
Language: *Java*\n
Built in methods used: toCharArray, substring\n
Own implementation methods: getChar, (string) length\n

###Q7
Language: *C*\n
Built in methods used: None\n
Own implementation methods: strlen\n

###Q8
Language: *Java*\n
