# Principles of Programming 2 Coursework 2. 
8 programs in C &amp; Java to solve some simple problems:

'Built in methods used' excludes using output functions or any methods that are used for inputting the files used for testing (as these were not part of the original task itself).
Note: as length (of an array) is a property rather than method in Java it is not included.

### Q1
Language: **C**  
Built in methods used: None  
Own implementation methods: strlen, stringToInt (rough reimplementation of strtol), pow, intToString (reimplementation of sprintf), createRand (rather than using rand).  

### Q2
Language: **Java**  
Built in methods used: toCharArray  
Own implementation methods: getChar  

### Q3
Language: **C**  
Built in methods used: malloc, realloc, sizeOf  
Own implementation methods: strlen (& created own boolean type)  

### Q4
Language: **Java**  

### Q5
Language: **C**  
Built in methods used: malloc, sizeOf  
Own implementation methods: strlen (& created own boolean type)  

### Q6
Language: **Java**  
The program has been tested on the entire book and worked as intended however due to the book's length it took a large amount of time, so I have add another file which stores chapter 1's text. This file is then read by the program as it is quicker and still shows the program's functionality. However, all code for file reading is left so that it is possible to change this to redact the entire book rather than one chapter if wanted. This is controlled by line 6.  
The redacted text output is outputted to a txt file named redactedOutput which is placed in Files/Q6 with the other files relating to this question.  
Built in methods used: toCharArray, substring  
Own implementation methods: getChar, (string) length  

### Q7
Language: **C**  
Built in methods used: None  
Own implementation methods: strlen  

### Q8
Language: **Java**  
Built in methods used: None  
Own implementation methods: mod
