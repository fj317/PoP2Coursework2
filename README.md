# PoP2Coursework2
Principles of Programming 2 Coursework 2. 8 programs in C &amp; Java to solve some simple problems:

'Built in methods used' excludes using output functions or any methods that are used for inputting the files used for testing (as these were not part of the original task itself).
Note: as length (of an array) is a property rather than method in Java it is not included.

Language: C
Built in methods used: None
Own implementation methods: strlen, stringToInt (rough reimplementation of strtol), pow, intToString (reimplementation of sprintf), createRand (rather than using rand).

Q2
Language: Java
Built in methods used: toCharArray
Own implementation methods: getChar

Q3
Language: C
Built in methods used: malloc, realloc, sizeOf
Own implementation methods: strlen (& created own boolean type)

Q4
Language: Java

Q5
Language: C
