CHAPTER I  “Well, ******, so ***** and ***** are now just family estates of the ************ *** I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that ************ really believe he is ************ will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! *** how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”  It was in ****, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known **** ******** *******, maid of honor and favorite of the ******* ***** ********** **** these words she greeted ****** ****** *******, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. **** ******** had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in *** **********, used only by the elite.  *** her invitations without exception, written in ******, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:  “If you have nothing better to do, ***** (or ******), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette *********  “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined ****** in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to **** ********, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.  “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.  “Can one be well while suffering morally? *** one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said **** ********* “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?”  “And the fete at the ******* ambassador’s? ***** is ********** I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.”  “I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”  “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.  “Don’t tease! ****, and what has been decided about ************* dispatch? *** know everything.”  “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? **** have decided that ********** has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”  ****** ****** always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. **** ******** ******* on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.  In the midst of a conversation on political matters **** ******** burst out:  “Oh, don’t speak to me of ******** ******* I don’t understand things, but ******* never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! ****** alone must save ******* *** gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! *** good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that *** will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! ** alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the ******* *********** loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate ****** *** wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did *********** get? ***** *** ******* have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our ******* who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? *******! *** what little they have promised they will not perform! ******* has always declared that ********** is invincible, and that all ****** is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word that ********** says, or ******** either. This famous ******** neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in *** and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save ******!”  *** suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.  “I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead of our dear ************* you would have captured the **** of ********* consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?”  “In a moment. A propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le ******* de *********, who is connected with the ************ through the ******, one of the best ****** families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the **** ****** ** you know that profound thinker? ** has been received by the ******** *** you heard?”  “I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is it true that the ******* ******* wants ***** ***** to be appointed first secretary at ******* *** baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”  ****** ****** wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the ******* ******* ***** ********* to secure it for the baron.  **** ******** almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the ******* desired or was pleased with.  “Baron ***** has been recommended to the ******* ******* by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.  ** she named the *******, **** ********** face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that *** ******* had deigned to show ***** ***** beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.  *** prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, **** ******** wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the *******) and at the same time to console him, so she said:  “Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? **** say she is amazingly beautiful.”  *** prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.  “I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of *******, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”  *** she smiled her ecstatic smile.  “I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.”  “Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? ******* ourselves” (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at *** ********* and you were pitied....”  *** prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.  “What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but ******* is an active one. That is the only difference between them.” ** said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.  “And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said **** ********, looking up pensively.  “I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!”  ** said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. **** ******** meditated.  “Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son ********* she asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, ******** **** *************  ****** ****** did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.  “Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, “that ******* is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? ***,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?” ********* he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?”  “Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known ****** ********* who had to retire from the army under the late *******, and was nicknamed ‘the **** of ********* ** is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married **** ****** lately. He is an aide-de-camp of ********* and will be here tonight.”  “Listen, dear *******,” said the prince, suddenly taking **** ********** hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that’s all I want.”  *** with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.  “Attendez,” said **** ********, reflecting, “I’ll speak to ****, young *********** wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.”
